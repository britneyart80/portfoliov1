## About Me

My name is Britney Chen and I am a student at Northeastern University pursuing a BS in Computer Science and Design, and a minor in Leadership and Human Capital. I attended an international school representing over 52 countries and through that, I've learned how to communicate and collaborate with many different types of people. I have been passionate about the arts ever since I was little, and after getting a taste of the programming world, I am eager to keep on building and learning as much as I can. Please enjoy looking through my
portfolio and projects, and I hope to be in contact with you.
